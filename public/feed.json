This post explains why fine-tuning is key to resolving tool selection ambiguity (e.g., internal vs. Google search) and achieving ultra-specialization, transforming it into a strict, enterprise-compliant agent. A case study demonstrates the improved logic. It also introduces the \"FunctionGemma Tuning Lab,\" a no-code demo on Hugging Face Spaces, which streamlines the entire fine-tuning process for developers.",
